# Blink Example

A classic "Hello World" example for Arduino, built with PlatformIO. This project blinks the built-in LED and prints status messages to the Serial Monitor.

## Features

- **LED Control**: Blinks the built-in LED (ON/OFF) every second.
- **Serial Logging**: Outputs "LED is ON" and "LED is OFF" messages to the Serial Monitor.
- **Multi-Board Support**: Configured for both Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.

## Hardware Required

- **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** or **Arduino Uno R3**
- USB Cable for connection to PC

## Software Dependencies

- **PlatformIO** (VS Code Extension)

## How to Use

1.  **Clone/Download** this repository.
2.  Open the project in **VS Code** with **PlatformIO**.
3.  **Upload** the firmware to your Arduino board.
4.  Open the **Serial Monitor** (set to 9600 baud).
5.  Observe the built-in LED blinking and the messages in the monitor.
